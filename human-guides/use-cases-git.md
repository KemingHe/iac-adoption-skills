## First-Time Setup

Configure git identity (required before committing):

```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

> [!TIP]
>
> Use the email associated with your GitHub account. For privacy, use your GitHub-provided `noreply` email: `username@users.noreply.github.com`

Verify configuration:

```shell
git config --global --list
```

---

## Multiple Identities

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Advanced** topic. Skip if you only use one Git identity.

Use `includeIf` to auto-switch identity based on directory, for example:

```gitconfig
# ~/.gitconfig
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = personal@email.com

[includeIf "gitdir:~/work/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-work
```

```gitconfig
# ~/.gitconfig-work
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = work@company.com
    signingkey = WORK_GPG_KEY_ID
```

Repos under `~/work/` automatically use work identity. No manual switching needed.

## Clone and Setup

```shell
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name

# Verify remotes
git remote -v

# Check current state
git status
git branch -a
```

> [↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---

## Create Feature Branch

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Always branch from up-to-date `main`. One branch = one issue.

```shell
# Update main first
git switch main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git switch -c [type]/[description]/[username]
git push -u origin [type]/[description]/[username]
```

**Branch naming**: `type/description/username`

| Type | Use For |
| :--- | :--- |
| `feat` | New features |
| `fix` | Bug fixes |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring |

## Work on Changes

### Check Status

```shell
git status                    # Full status
git status -s                 # Short format
git diff                      # Unstaged changes
git diff --staged             # Staged changes
```

### Commit Changes

```shell
git add .                     # Stage all
git add [file]                # Stage specific file
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```

### View History

```shell
git log --oneline -10         # Recent commits
git log main..HEAD --oneline  # Commits on this branch only
git log --oneline --graph     # Visual branch structure
git show [commit-sha]         # Full details of a commit
```

## Keep Branch Current

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Rebase regularly to avoid conflicts. Always rebase before submitting PR.

### Simple Rebase (Most Cases)

```shell
# Update main and rebase
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts occur
git add .                     # Stage resolved files
git rebase --continue         # Continue rebase

# Push updated branch
git push --force-with-lease origin [branch-name]
```

### Selective Rebase (After Squash-Merge)

Use when your branch contains commits from a previously squash-merged PR.

```shell
# Find where to cut
git log main..HEAD --oneline

# Rebase excluding already-merged commits
git rebase --onto origin/main [last-merged-commit-sha]

# Push updated branch
git push --force-with-lease origin [branch-name]
```

> [!TIP]
>
> `[last-merged-commit-sha]` is the SHA of the last commit that was already merged to main via squash-merge.

### Cancel Rebase

```shell
git rebase --abort            # Cancel and restore previous state
```

> [↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---

## Submit and Merge

```shell
# Verify branch is ready
git log main..HEAD --oneline  # Review your commits
git diff main..HEAD --stat    # Summary of changes

# Push final changes
git push origin [branch-name]
```

Then create PR on GitHub linking to the approved issue.

## Post-Merge Cleanup

After PR is merged:

```shell
# Update local main
git switch main
git pull origin main

# Delete local feature branch
git branch -D [branch-name]

# Delete remote feature branch (if not auto-deleted)
git push origin --delete [branch-name]

# Clean stale references
git fetch origin --prune
```

## Stashing Work in Progress

Temporarily save changes when switching context.

### Stash and Restore

```shell
# Save current work, add -u flag to include unstaged files
git stash -m "WIP: description"

# Switch to other branch, do work, return

# Restore stashed work
git stash pop                 # Apply and remove from stash
git stash apply               # Apply but keep in stash
```

### Manage Stashes

```shell
git stash list                # View all stashes
git stash show -p             # View stash contents
git stash drop                # Delete latest stash
git stash clear               # Delete ALL stashes
```

## Recovery and Troubleshooting

### Reset Operations

| Mode | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--soft` | Undo commit, keep staged changes |
| `--mixed` | Undo commit, unstage changes (default) |
| `--hard` | Undo commit, discard all changes |

```shell
git reset HEAD~1              # Undo last commit (mixed)
git reset --soft HEAD~1       # Undo commit, keep staged
git reset --hard HEAD~1       # Undo and discard (DESTRUCTIVE)
```

### Recovery

```shell
git reflog                    # View recent branch states
git reset --hard [commit-sha] # Reset to specific state
```

### File Case Detection

Case-only renames aren't detected on case-insensitive filesystems (macOS, Windows):

```shell
# Wrong - won't be tracked
mv readme.md README.md
git status                    # Shows "nothing to commit"

# Correct - use git mv
git mv readme.md README.md
git commit -m "refactor: correct filename casing"
```

> [!TIP]
> Always use `git mv` for case changes. Avoid `git config core.ignorecase false` as it breaks compatibility.

### URL Rewriting Issues

**Symptom**: You clone a repo using an HTTPS URL, but get an SSH error:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
# Cloning into 'repo'...
# git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
```

**Cause**: A `url.<base>.insteadOf` rule in your Git config is silently rewriting HTTPS URLs to SSH. This is often set intentionally (see [SSH guide - URL Rewriting](./use-cases-ssh-authentication.md#url-rewriting)) but can cause confusion if forgotten.

**Diagnose**:

```shell
# Check for any URL rewriting rules
git config --global --list | grep insteadof
```

If you see output like `url.git@github.com:.insteadof=https://github.com/`, that rule is converting your HTTPS clone URLs to SSH.

**Fix**:

```shell
# Remove all rewriting rules for git@github.com:
git config --global --unset-all url."git@github.com:".insteadOf
```

After removing the rule, HTTPS clone commands will work as expected without requiring SSH key setup.

> [!TIP]
>
> If an SSH connection was attempted before you found this issue, your SSH client (such as the `ssh` command or Git over SSH) may have added a host key to `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. See [SSH guide - Managing Known Hosts](./use-cases-ssh-authentication.md#managing-known-hosts) for cleanup instructions.
