How to contribute to `common-devx` - adding skills, guides, and templates.

## Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- SSH key configured for GitHub access (see [`use-cases-ssh-authentication.md`](./human-guides/use-cases-ssh-authentication.md))
- GPG key configured for commit signing (see [`use-cases-gpg-commit-signing.md`](./human-guides/use-cases-gpg-commit-signing.md))

## Development Model

This repository uses **trunk-based development**:

- `main` is the single source of truth
- Feature branches are short-lived (days, not weeks)
- All PRs merge to `main` via squash-and-merge
- Rebase before submitting PR (see [`use-cases-git.md`](./human-guides/use-cases-git.md))

## Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> All contributions require an approved issue first.

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Wait for issue approval from [@KemingHe](https://github.com/KemingHe) | Start work before approval |
| One PR per issue | Multi-issue PRs |
| Keep branches short-lived | Long-standing feature branches |
| Rebase before submitting PR | Merge commits from main |
| Self-review all content | Submit unreviewed AI-generated content (AI-slop) |
| Respond to feedback within 14 days | Let PR go stale |

**AI-assisted contributions are welcome**, but you must review and understand _every line_. PRs that appear to be unreviewed AI output will be closed.

## Contribution Types
