# README - Contact Management

> **Last Updated**: 2026-02-26 by Keming He

Manage contact information by adding, updating, or validating entries from various sources.

## Quick Start

Use this skill when you need to:

- Add a new contact from LinkedIn or email signature
- Update existing contact with new information
- Validate contact completeness before meetings

Tell your AI agent: "Add contact from this LinkedIn profile" or "Update John's contact info".

## How It Works

1. **Extract**: AI gathers info from LinkedIn, email signatures, or conversation
2. **Validate**: Checks email format, required fields, consistency
3. **Request**: Actively asks for missing required information
4. **Confirm**: Shows entry for approval before writing

## Contact Fields

| Field | Required | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Name, Title, Company, Email | Yes | Core identification |
| Phone, LinkedIn, GitHub | No | Additional contact methods |
| Timezone, Specializations | No | Useful for scheduling and routing questions |
